## Tinker - Rails Routes

### Intro

These notes were created as part of my notes in my own words trying to understand certain concepts. This time it's on Rails Routes. Before this I sort of understood the overview of MVC Rails Architecture but not in depth. I went through many articles and app tutorials, app tutorials not specifically on Rails Routes, explaining on Rails routing system but I never took the effort in explaining it in depth of what I understood. As usual, there's alot more to learn. I am sure I will continue to update this as time goes by and refer these notes. 

The best way to learn (re-learn) is to clone the repo to your local, run Rails server and read these notes. Re-learn The Rules & Concept. Practice on the Rules & Concept. Break the Rules & re-Conceptualize



> P.S. The original copy of this aricle, is part of a chapter from Zakir's markdown Ruby Coding Notes (by now 59050 Words ) and pasted in `README` GitHub Repo `tinker_rails_routes`



> P.P.S. Please don't take these notes and my repo as true and error free. I am far from an expert. Please correct me if any of these are wrong. This is just merely my way of understanding my own thoughts, so that I can refer, and hopefully improve my understanding of the topic :)
